# AWS LocalStack Lab

A hands-on learning repository demonstrating real-world AWS DevOps concepts using LocalStack - a local AWS cloud emulator. Each branch is a standalone lab focusing on one core AWS skill.

## Lab Structure

This repository uses a **branch-per-lab** model. Each lab is self-contained and teaches one AWS concept:

- **`testing/pipeline`** - CI/CD Pipeline with S3 deployment
- **`testing/iam`** - IAM least-privilege and role-based access ⚠️ *Pro only*
- **`testing/ecr`** - Container Registry with Docker and ECR ⚠️ *Pro only*
- More labs coming soon...

> **📝 LocalStack Limitations:** IAM policy enforcement and ECR require LocalStack Pro (paid). Community Edition users can:
> - Use these labs with a free-tier AWS account instead
> - Study AWS CLI syntax with the provided flashcards (`AWS_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.tsv`)
> - Learn workflows and concepts even if enforcement doesn't work locally

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wjs4572/aws-localstack-lab.git
cd aws-localstack-lab
git checkout testing/pipeline   # Start with the pipeline lab
```

## Prerequisites (All Labs)

- Docker
- LocalStack (running on `http://localhost:4566`)
- AWS CLI v2
- Bash or Git Bash (Windows)
- PowerShell (Windows users)

### Setup LocalStack

```bash
docker run -d -p 4566:4566 localstack/localstack
```

### Configure AWS CLI

**For LocalStack:**

```bash
aws configure --profile localstack
# AWS Access Key ID: test
# AWS Secret Access Key: test
# Default region: us-east-1
# Default output format: json
```

**For Real AWS (IAM/ECR labs):**

See **[AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md)** for complete instructions on:
- Creating a free AWS account
- Setting up IAM user with proper permissions
- Configuring AWS CLI credentials
- Using real AWS with the labs

> 💡 **Tip:** To use real AWS for labs marked "Pro only":
> ```bash
> source ./config.sh
> use_aws              # Switches to real AWS
> use_localstack       # Switches back to LocalStack
> ```
> Or edit `config.sh` and set `USE_REAL_AWS=true`

### Load Helper Functions

**Bash/WSL:**

```bash
source ./setup.sh
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
. .\setup.ps1
```

This loads AWS utilities including:
- `awscmd` - Works with both LocalStack and real AWS
- `awslocal` - Alias for backward compatibility
- `use_aws` - Switch to real AWS in current session
- `use_localstack` - Switch back to LocalStack

## What You'll Learn

This lab series covers essential AWS DevOps skills that employers expect:

- ✅ CI/CD pipelines with AWS services
- ✅ IAM security and least-privilege access
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ Container deployments
- ✅ Real-world DevOps workflows

All safely practiced locally with LocalStack - no AWS charges!
